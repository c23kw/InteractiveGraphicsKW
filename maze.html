   <p id=text1>My Basic Animation: My plan for this project was to make a maze game, as I thought it would be a doable, yet interesting game to create in BASIC. I utilized progams for snake games to figure out the code to make the player move based on arrow key inputs, and then added the extra layer of what happend when you hit a "wall".</p>

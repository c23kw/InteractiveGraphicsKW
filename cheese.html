		  <p id=text1> 3D scene using WebGL and P5: Since I am a big fan of cheese, and specifically cheese boards, I thought it would be cool to try and create a realistic looking cheesboard on the computer. Specifically, I thought the many components of what could be incolved in a cheese board, spanning from the board itself, to the different kinds of cheeses, left a lot of space to implement the various things we learned in class. Overall, I really like how this turned out, and it totally looks like something I would make, or eat from, in real life!</p>
